# Interest-Calc
A C++ program to calculate the total interest earned and final balance of a savings account, given starting balance, 
Annual interest rate, and monthly deposits

This program was written by me both for practice, and as proof of my basic programming skills. It is my hope that I an develop it further
by turning it into an AWS Lambda function which can be invoked using EC2, or from a Static Website.
